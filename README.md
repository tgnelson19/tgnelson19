I am a very amateur developer attempting things that are probably outside of my area, but I'm doing 'em anyway because why not. I'm interested
in games for the most part, and trying to create things that really shouldn't exist in SFML's C++ library. 

You can reach me at nelson.tyler.g@gmail.com if you have compliments, questions, or concerns.
